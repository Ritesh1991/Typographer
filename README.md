Borrowed from http://patriciogonzalezvivo.com/butterfly.html , We are trying to recode his project for our Affiliate program activities, we will organize and create augmented reality learning labs called Augmented Reality Centers (ARC) in order to raise funds and awareness for our mission. ARC implements Socratic questioning practices in a multimodal-learning environment. ARC’s use technology to make learning fun and accessible, thereby engaging the student first before being taught. ARC affords a rich contextual learning environment for skill acquisition. The learning environment makes use of Interactive Product Content Management(IPCM), which includes interactive 3D manipulative digital replicas. ARC’s also make use ofSimulation Based Learning (SBL), which includes simulation and virtual reality based training and interactive experiential learning. The content, which is used in this learning environment, is one that makes learning inherently interesting since it is based upon an amalgamation of theAffiliate schools’ needs assessments. Students engaged in multimodal learning, on average, outperform students who learn using traditional uni-modal learning.
