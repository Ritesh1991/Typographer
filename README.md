===========

Borrowed from http://patriciogonzalezvivo.com/butterfly.html , we are trying to recode/update Patricio Gonzalez Vivo's project for various iOs and OS platforms of our Affiliate program activities. eLearner Network is a not-for-profit which will organize and create augmented reality learning labs called Augmented Reality Centers (ARC) in order to raise funds and awareness for our mission. Funds generated will only be used to cover the costs incurred in creating ARCs in public schools. ARC implements Socratic questioning practices in a multimodal-learning environment. ARC’s use technology to make learning fun and accessible, thereby engaging the student first before being taught. ARC affords a rich contextual learning environment for skill acquisition. The learning environment makes use of Interactive Product Content Management(IPCM), which includes interactive 3D manipulative digital replicas. ARC’s also make use of Simulation Based Learning (SBL), which includes simulation and virtual reality based training and interactive experiential learning. The content, which is used in this learning environment, is one that makes learning inherently interesting since it is based upon an amalgamation of theAffiliate schools’ needs assessments. Students engaged in multimodal learning, on average, outperform students who learn using traditional uni-modal learning. 

SPECIAL THANKS TO PATRICIO GONZALEZ VIVO for putting this code out!!!!

Eden it´s migrating to ofxEden. A openFrameworks addon that simulates the a ecosystem from the surface of a sandBox.

Now it´s using ofxComposer and ofxGui for a more intuitive and beautiful setup.


## MacOSX Pre-Requisit

Macports is required to be installed. Please check http://www.macports.org/ for its own dependencies and installation procedure. It requires XCode and would need to be installed on your Mac. Then:
